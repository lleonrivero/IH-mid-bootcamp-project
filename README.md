1. About the project
The SAMUR (Servicio de Asistencia Municipal de Urgencias y Rescates) is a municipal emergency health care service that provides its services in the city of Madrid.

According to data published on its website, in 2021 this service achieved an overall response time of 9 minutes and 34 seconds (574 seconds) from the time the call is received to the arrival of the ambulance.

Using the data of the first semester of 2022, the aim of the present analytical study is to analyze the data and build a model able to explain those cases in which the response time is above average.
